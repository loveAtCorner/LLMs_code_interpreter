The templates are used to structure the input and output of a chatbot or dialogue system, ensuring that the data is formatted consistently and includes the necessary context for each message.\n\nThe script defines the following classes and functions:\n\n1. `Template`: A dataclass representing a template for formatting conversational data. It contains attributes for different formatters (e.g., for user, assistant, system messages) and other settings like default_system, stop_words, etc.\n\n2. `Llama2Template`: A subclass of `Template` with a specific implementation for the Llama2 template.\n\n3. `_register_template`: A function that registers new templates with a given name and their respective formatters and settings. It also supports adding or replacing special tokens in the tokenizer based on the template.\n\n4. `_add_or_replace_eos_token`: A helper function to add or replace the end-of-sequence (EOS) token in the tokenizer.\n\n5. `_jinja_escape`: A helper function to escape single quotes in a given content string.\n\n6. `_convert_slots_to_jinja`: A helper function to convert a list of slots into a Jinja-formatted string.\n\n7. `_get_jinja_template`: A helper function to generate a Jinja template based on a `Template` instance and a tokenizer.\n\n8. `get_template_and_fix_tokenizer`: A function that retrieves a registered template and adjusts the tokenizer according to the template's requirements.\n\n9. A series of `_register_template` calls: These lines register specific templates with their respective formatters and settings. Each template has a unique name and a set of formatting rules for user, assistant, system messages, and other elements.\n\nThe output of this script, when executed, would be a dictionary `TEMPLATES` containing the registered templates, which can then be used to format and preprocess conversational data for training or evaluating a dialogue system. The templates are designed to work with the Hugging Face Transformers library, specifically with `PreTrainedTokenizer` instances, to handle tokenization and special tokens required for each template."
